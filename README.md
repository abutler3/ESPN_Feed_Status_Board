ESPN Feed Status Board widget
======================

A small HTML widget that uses the ESPN Feed API to display latest sports news on Panic's iPad app, Status Board.

How to use:

1. Fork it
2. Go to http://developer.espn.com/ to get an ESPN Feed API (it's free)
3. Once you get your API Key, paste it where you see 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' in the HTML file
4. Upload file to your server
5. Open Status Board on your iPad, go to Settings, drag Do-It-Yourself button and drag it to the board. Tap the new panel and paste the web address
6. Enjoy, modify, etc.

TODOS
-----
1. Right now, it does not refresh automatically. You have to triple-tap the panel to activate refresh. In the future, I will have it refresh every 5 minutes.
2. Add links to each headline.
3. Style changes.


THANK YOUS
----------
I was unable to attend @hacknashville because, well, I was watching the NBA playoffs. Consider this to be my contribution.
The project is a modification of Gunther Groenewege's original implementation of a Things.app integration into Status Board. I kept most of the CSS styles, which came with some recommendations from Panic and stripped out the Things code. Thanks to him for putting up his project.
